# Binary 2 Array
A simple HTML5 page to convert any binary file to an array.  
_Personal project made for Arduino (and ESP32) projects._

Just drop or open a file in the page:  
https://adrianotiger.github.io/binary2array/  
and press `convert` to have a binary array of your file.  

## Settings
Before converting, you can apply some settings to the converter.  
Open <a href='settings.md'>Converter Settings</a> to see all converting options.  

If you open an image, you will get some other settings to apply:  
Open <a href='imagesettings.md'>Image Settings</a> to see all converting options.  

## Arduino
This project was made for Arduino and TFT displays. So there is also a section with some info about the conversion.
